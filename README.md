# Jupyter notebook demo repository

Introducing basics of Jupyter Notebook (intended to be used in
presentation / chat).

Often I need to introduce the notebook in a discussion, and everytime
I look for a simple example on my file system. This repository is
meant to be a substitute.

This can also be used to demo ipynb-file rendering on github (subdirectory
`executed-notebooks`), or to demonstrate the MyBinder service:

Examples:

* 1-basics.ipynb: ([static rendering on github](executed-notebooks/1-basics-executed.ipynb)), ([Interactive execution on Binder ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/jupyter-demo/master?filepath=1-basics.ipynb))

* 2-widgets:([static rendering on github](executed-notebooks/2-widgets-executed.ipynb)), ([interactive execution on Binder ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/jupyter-demo/master?filepath=2-widgets.ipynb))
